# Marching Cubes 
### A learning tool

This small project is meant to create an interactive learning tool for understanding how the Marching Cubes algorithm works. Please note that due to time constraints this project does not cover all cases, and may not account for furhter improvements to the algorithm made after Nielson and Hamann.

To run the project locally, you must have node v20 installed. Use the following commands to install packages and run locally:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
